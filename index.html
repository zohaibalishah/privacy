        Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even
        further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers'
        access to your INDISCAN app if you haven't used their app in 6 months,
        and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will reduce
        the data that an app can request without app review to include only
        name, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will
        require our approval.

        anyone, and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our
        partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of
        third parties we share information with:
      </p>

      <h4strong> Partners who use our analytics services.</h4strong>

        their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share
        information that personally identifies you (information such as your
        name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or
        identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we
        provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for
        example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34
        who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better
        understand their audience. We also confirm which INDISCAN app ads led
        you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.

        seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your
        public information and other information you share with them, as well as
        the information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping
        and contact details.
      </p>
      <strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong>
      <p>
        We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who
        support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure
        services, analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer
        service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys.
      </p>

      <strong>Researchers and academics.</strong>

        or others share with third-party partners in the INDISCAN user app and

      </p>

      <h2>How do the INDISCAN LLC Companies work together?</h2>
      <p>
        INDISCAN LLC share infrastructure, systems and technology with
        other INDISCAN LLC Companies (which include Indiscan user and Indiscan
        Vendor App) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe
        experience across all INDISCAN LLC Company Products you use. We also
        process information about you across the INDISCAN LLC Companies for
        these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with
        their terms and policies. For example, we process information from
        Indiscan user app about accounts sending spam on its service so we can
        take appropriate action against those accounts. We also work to
        understand how people use and interact with INDISCAN LLC Company
        Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different
        INDISCAN LLC Company Products.
      </p>

      <h2>How can I manage or delete information about me?</h2>
      <p>
        We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your
        data. Learn more in your INDISCAN user app and INDISCAN VENDOR app
        Settings.
      </p>

      <p>
        We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services
        and INDISCAN LLC Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever
        comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things
        like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and
        relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you
        search for something on INDISCAN user app, you can access and delete
        that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of
        that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit a copy of your
        government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that
        copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as
        your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover that
        information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't
        part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't want to delete
        your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can

      <h2>How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</h2>
      <p>
        We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law
        enforcement or others:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or
          subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to
          do so. This may include responding to legal requests from
          jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith
          belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,
          affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with
          internationally recognized standards.
        </li>
        <li>
          When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent
          and address fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our
          terms or policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect
          ourselves (including our rights, property or Products), you or others,
          including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or to
          prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we
          provide information to and receive information from third-party
          partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse
          and other harmful activity on and off our Products.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data
        related to purchases made with INDISCAN App) can be accessed and
        preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal
        request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of
        possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent
        harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for terms
        violations for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term
        violations.
      </p>
      <h2>
        How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?
      </h2>

      <p>
        We share information globally, both internally within the INDISCAN LLC
        Companies, and externally with our partners and with those you connect
        and share with around the world in accordance with this policy. Your
        information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or
        stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of
        where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. These data
        transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in
        the INDISCAN LLC Terms to globally operate and provide our Products to
        you. We utilize standard contract clauses, rely on the European
        Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable,
        and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States
        and other countries.
      </p>

      <h2>How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</h2>

      <p>
        We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the
        opportunity to review the revised policy before you choose to continue
        using our Products.
