        account.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data

      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>

        </li>

        <li>
          <u>Device permissions. </u> Mobile platforms have permission systems
          for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone
          book and location services as well as push notifications. You can
          change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the
          collection of the corresponding information or the display of the
          corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key
        points to remember:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>Reviewing your information. </u>
          Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal
          information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may
          be called right of access, right of portability or variations of those
          terms). You can request a copy of your personal information by putting
          in such a request.
        </li>

        <li>
          <u>Updating your information. </u>
          If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or
          that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its
          rectification, deletion or object to its processing, please contact
          us.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask
        you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above
        requests.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if
        the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or
        intellectual property or the privacy of another user. If you wish to
        receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any
        messages you received from him or her through our service, the other
        user will have to contact our Privacy Officer to provide their written
        consent before the information is released.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to
        the processing of personal information, notably where such requests
        would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance,
        we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>Uninstall</u>
          You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it
          using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall
          the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with
          your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install the
          application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate
          this identifier to your previous transactions and activities.
        </li>

        <li>
          <u>Accountability.</u> In certain countries, including in the European
          Union, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data
          protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your
          personal information. The data protection authority you can lodge a
          complaint with notably may be that of your habitual residence, where
          you work or where we are established.
